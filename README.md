# ArthaShield Explainability Engine

An open-source project by the **ArthaShield Collective** to make AI reasoning transparent and human-understandable â€” for regulators, developers, and citizens.

##  Vision
AI systems influence decisions in banking, finance, insurance, and governance.  
The Explainability Engine bridges the gap between complex model reasoning and the clarity required by oversight teams.

##  Current MVP
- **Backend:** FastAPI or Java Spring oot service that parses model traces  
- **Frontend:** React dashboard to visualize insights  
- **Output:** Plain-language summaries, confidence scores, and risk highlights  

##  Why Co-Create
This initiative welcomes contributors from India and beyond to:
- Build transparent AI together  
- Create open explainability standards  
- Develop community-owned tools for regulators and enterprises
